# Semibot Sliders
**[ BETA ]** More features may be added in the future.

Adds body slider customization to semibots.

## Usage
Body segment sizes can be customized via the `Semibot Sliders` button found in the change color menu.

## Settings
There are mod config settings to constrain the scaling of the body sliders.
This can be used to locally limit the scaling of other players who may be using excessive values.
